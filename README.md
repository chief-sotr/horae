# Horae
```Grow healthy plants```

## Product vision

WHY
- Plants are not created equal and adapt in each specific environment differently. Each gardener have different experiences with their plants. Growing plants should be easy and predictable, not just for botanists. 
- The amount of online information is overwhelming, confusing and often too basic = not applicable (ie. Mountain town vs. arid city). 
- I want to build a generation of self-sufficient plant lovers that want to develop a hobby with complex rare plants, decorate their house with one easy plant, or grow crops to feed their family. Being able to grow your own crops is critical to survive in case of disaster. 
- Local self-sufficiency = local economic opportunities. 

WHO
- Hobbyist and beginner home gardeners (Abby) that need an easy way to track each plant and their growth over time so that they can increase chances of having healthier and happier plants.
- Gardeners (Jasper) that want to plan and develop an easy agricultural system so that they can become self-sufficient and increase their return on investment. 

WHAT
- User: any user that is growing a plant
- Environment: location of the place (position in space, light situation, GPS, etc.)
- Track: data collection from the user
- Guidance: how to best care for your plant in the given environment
- Horae will allow the users to track the growth and health of each of their plant through time to better identify and understand the success factors in growing any given plant in its current environment. 
- Horae will have a database of information sourced from all users of the product so any given user can access predictable guidance on how to grow a plant in their specific environment.  

WHEN
- Start with a prototype for small sample user testing
- User should be able to use the app whenever they think about the care and development of their plant(s) 
- User should be able to use the app whenever they go shopping for new plants and want predictable guidance
- User should be able to track their plants with easy access to the history

WHERE
- Anywhere

KPIs
- I want to make it easy for users to track their plants growth as measured by the increase of average weekly active users (AWAU). 
- I want to make it easy for users to help improve the product experience as measured by the increase of NPS.
